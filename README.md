# Analysis of PyBer Rides, Fares, and Drivers by Specific City Types

## Overview of PyBer Ride Statistics
Data of rides, fares, and drivers was collected and merged together to create a single dataset of all the data. Information was collected from urban, suburban, and rural city types and then graphed to give a visual comparison of the three seperate city types.

## PyBer Analysis Results
The urban city types had a significant higher amount of divers and riders verus rural and suburban city types. However, the urban city types had lower average fare per rider, as well as lower fare per driver, as opposed to the rural city types. Despite the urban city type having the overall lower fares, it still had a much higher total dollar amount for their total fares. As expected, the urban city type also showed more riders and drivers while the suburban and rural city types had fewer riders and drivers in comparison. I have included a line chart to show the summary comparison between the three city types.

## Summary of the PyBer Analysis

I would recommend finding a way to economically add more drivers to the suburban, but mostly the rural, city types. If more drivers were available then there would be lower costs per rider thus encouraging more riders. With that, I would also suggest creating a way for suburban and rural riders to schedule rides and blind carpools. This would help drivers in taking more riders going in similar directions at the same time and avoiding a back and forth drive for drivers. This would cut down on time and expenses for the drivers while increasing fares but also reducing fares for the riders.
